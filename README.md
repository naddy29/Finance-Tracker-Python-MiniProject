# Finance-Tracker-Python-MiniProject
Managing personal finances and tracking expenses are essential tasks for
individuals and households to maintain financial stability and make informed financial
decisions.
<br>
 Our project i.e. ‚ÄùExpense Tracker" is a user-friendly and intuitive software
solution designed to simplify expense management and provide insights into spending
patterns.
</br>
<br>
The project comprises a user interface developed using the Tkinter library in Python.
It offers multiple features, including expense entry, categorization, and visualization tools.
Users can input their daily expenses, categorize them under predefined categories, and
view a summary of their financial transactions with the specific dates the expense was
added on. Apart from that, it includes a graphical representation of their spendings at a
glance with the help of pie chart and line graph displayed category-wise and Date-wise
respectively. The expenses added by the user will also be saved on their device in the form
of a csv file. It also includes a feature to track expenses made on behalf of friends or group
members.
</br>
It promotes financial awareness and helps users take control of their budgeting and
spending habits. We believe that it serves as a practical solution for individuals seeking to
simplify expense management and gain insights into their financial activities. It can be
easily customized and extended to meet specific user requirements.
